LUX is all about making it easy to create mobile apps.
It's for professional developers, to make their lives easier.
But it also empowers non-coders, or semi-technical users like UI designers, to create full blown apps.

LUX is new declarative language.  I call it a functional reactive markup language.
It's like JSON or XML or JSX, but more powerful.  In some ways it's like a better, more concise, more powerful XAML.

Let's see it in action.  Here's LUX on the left, in Visual Studio, with the LUX language extension.
Note the JSON like declarative syntax.

In LUX I can create controls and set their properties, much like XAML today.
Note that as I type, the app is immediately updated, live, in the Android emulator on the right.
I can edit text, like say change the title.
Say I want to make the title bigger.  I can do that and see it take effect right away.

LUX is like XAML, but more powerful.
In LUX you can define functions.
